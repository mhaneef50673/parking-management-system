# Parking Management System

This project is a Parking Management System that allows users to manage parking spaces efficiently. It provides features for booking, viewing, and managing parking slots in real-time.

## Notes

This project uses localStorage to persist the component state. While this approach works for development and small-scale applications, it is not ideal for real-world scenarios where a database is typically used to persist data.

I have used this technique just for demostration purpose
